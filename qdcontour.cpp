 * \section intro_section Introduction
 *
 * The qdcontour program takes as input a control file, and depending
 * on the contents of the control file renders either contour images
 * from querydata, or maps from shapefiles.
 *
 * \section cmdline_section Command line options
 *
 * The program is used as follows:
 * \code
 * qdcontour [-v] [-f] [controlfile]
 * \endcode
 *
 * The options are
 * <dl>
 * <dt>-v</dt>
 * <dd>Verbose output. For example output files are printed.</dd>
 * <dt>-f</dt>
 * <dd>Force output. Normally qdcontour may decide not to draw
 *     some contour image since an image by that name already
 *     exists. This greatly speeds up contouring by omitting
 *     unnecessary redrawing. However, occasionally one
 *     changes the control file somehow, and a redraw must be
 *     done by using the -f option.
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 *
 * \section cmd_section Control file syntax
 *
 * \subsection comment_section Comments
 *
 * Normal comments of the following form are supported.
 * \code
 * # comment
 * // comment
 * command # comment
 * command // comment
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * \subsection variables_section Variables
 *
 * The control file parser does not at the moment provide support
 * for user defined variables. However, this may change in the
 * future.
 *
 * \subsection flowcontrol_section Flow control
 *
 * The control file parser provides for very little flow control,
 * in particular there are no loop structures.
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dl>
 * <dt>include [filename]</dt>
 * <dd>
 * The include command works via the NFmiPreProcessor class in
 * the newbase library.
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 * \endhtmlonly
 *
 * It would be possible to implement various extra conditional
 * directives in the \#if - \#else - \#endif style. For example,
 * one could automatically enable seasonal contouring colors
 * this way.
 *
 *
 * \section renderingshapefiles_section Rendering shapefiles
 *
 * A complete sample control file can be found in the
 * appendix at \ref shapesample_section.
 *
 * \subsection projection_section Specifying the projection
 *
 * Before an image containing possibly multiple individual
 * shapefiles can be rendered, one must specify the
 * projection and the bounding box of the area to be rendered.
 * There are multiple ways to do this, each one automatically
 * calculating the missing information.
 *
 * At the moment qdcontour supports only one projection,
 * the stereographic one. It is specified using the command
 * \code
 * stereographic [centrallongitude] [centrallatitude] [truelatitude]
 * \endcode
 * where <em>centrallongitude</em> is usually 25 when rendering Finland,
 * 20 for Skandinavia and 10 for Europe. <em>centrallatitude</em>
 * is almost always 90 to indicate the polar stereographic projection.
 * The true latitude is often chosen to be 60, so that the distortion
 * would be minimal at the latitudes of Finland.
 *
 * Once the projection has been specified, one must specify the
 * geographic bounding box as well as the image size. Below
 * we go through various ways of doing this.
 *
 * \code
 * bottomleft [longitude] [latitude]
 * topright [longitude] [latitude]
 * size [width] [height]
 * \endcode
 * In above we specify the bounding box of the geographic area
 * by giving the corner coordinates in geographic units (degrees).
 * Then we fix the size of the produced image in both X and Y
 * directions. In effect this means we can force a geographic
 * area to be rendered at some fixed size, which may distort
 * the map.
 *
 * A better alternative is
 * \code
 * bottomleft [longitude] [latitude]
 * topright [longitude] [latitude]
 * width [width]
 * \endcode
 * or
 * \code
 * bottomleft [longitude] [latitude]
 * topright [longitude] [latitude]
 * height [height]
 * \endcode
 * In these cases the missing image dimension is calculated
 * automatically so that the map will not be distorted.
 *
 * Often however specifying the corner points is very
 * inconvenient, one may have to perform several trials
 * before finding a reasonable area. Overall the best
 * strategy may be to use
 * \code
 * center [longitude] [latitude]
 * scale [scale]
 * size [width] [height]
 * \endcode
 * In this case one specifies the location to be placed
 * at the center of the map, the desired size of the image
 * and then adjusts the scale so that the desired area
 * is completely covered.
 *
 * The scale can be approximately interpreted to mean
 * how many kilometers one pixel is, but only roughly.
 *
 * \subsection shape_section Drawing a single shapefile
 *
 * There are two ways to render a shape file, either by filling
 * or stroking polyline or polygon data, or by placing markers
 * at point data.
 *
 * Polyline or polygon data rendering is controlled using the
 * command
 * \code
 * shape [shapefilename] [fillcolor] [strokecolor]
 * \endcode
 * where <em>shapefilename</em> is the name of the shape, without
 * any suffix such as .shp or .dbf. If the filename cannot
 * be found directly, the environmental <em>imagine::shapes_path</em>
 * is used to locate the file.
 *
 * The fillcolor and strokecolor can be in the form given
 * in \ref color_section. Often one of the colors is specified
 * to be <em>none</em>, indicating that either filling or
 * stroking is not to be done.
 *
 * Point data rendering is controlled using the command
 * \code
 * shape [shapefilename] mark [markerfilename] [blendingrule] [blendfactor]
 * \endcode
 * where <em>markefilename</em> is the image to be used as a marker.
 * The blending rules are explained in section \ref blending_section,
 * the <em>blendfactor</em> can be used as an extra alpha factor
 * in the range 0-1, but often one uses the value 1 to indicate no extra
 * blending is to be done.
 *
 * \subsection format_section Specifying the graphics format
 *
 * Before actually rending the final image, once should
 * choose the desired graphics format and adjust the
 * parameters related to the format as desired.
 *
 * The available commands are
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dl>
 * <dt>format [format]</dt>
 * <dd>where [format] may be one of png, jpg or gif. The default
 *     format is png.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>savealpha [0/1]</dt>
 * <dd>is used to choose whether the alpha channel of the rendered
 *     image should be saved or ignored. Typically on ignores
 *     the alpha channel, unless the image intentionally contains
 *     transparent areas. The default is to save alpha channel.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>wantpalette [0/1]</dt>
 * <dd>This option is relevant only to the png format, which is
 *     the only one that allows both palette and truecolor storage.
 *     The flag indicates whether qdcontour should <em>try</em>
 *     to store the image in palette mode, if it can. For png
 *     this means there can be atmost 256 different colors,
 *     including differences in alpha.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>forcepalette [0/1]</dt>
 * <dd>The intent is to enable forcing a palette save for png
 *     format. However, this has <b>not</b> been implemented yet.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>jpegquality [0-100]</dt>
 * <dd>This allows one to control the quality of the compressed
 *     jpeg image. The higher the number, the better the quality,
 *     but also the larger the image file will be. The default
 *     value is -1, which implies the default chosen by
 *     libjpeg is used.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>pngquality [1-9]</dt>
 * <dd>This allows one to control the compression level of
 *     the png format. The default value is -1, which implies
 *     the default chosen by libpng is used.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>alphalimit [-1-127]</dt>
 * <dd>Alphalimit enables one to enforce binary transparency,
 *     that is, alpha is either on or off. The actual values
 *     depend on the chosen image format. The value -1 implies
 *     binary transparency is not enforced. This value is
 *     most relevant for the gif format, which does not
 *     support full transparency.
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 * \endhtmlonly
 * Perhaps the set of most typical image format related commands is
 * \code
 * format png
 * savealpha 0
 * wantpalette 1
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection savingshape_section Saving the result
 *
 * Once the projection and the shapefile rendering directives
 * have been given, the actual output can be generated
 * using the command
 * \code
 * erase [color]
 * draw shapes [filename]
 * clear corners
 * clear sizes
 * clear shapes
 * \endcode
 * which causes all the shapefiles specified earlier to be
 * drawn in the given filename. The suffix of the filename
 * is chosen automatically according to the active graphics
 * format.
 *
 * The <em>erase</em> command essentially defines the background
 * color for the image. The default is to use transparent color,
 * which most likely is not suitable for most maps.
 *
 * The final three clearing commands do not have to be given,
 * but act as safety in case somebody intends to draw more
 * shapes in the same control file.
 *
 *
 * \section renderingcontours_section Rendering contours
 *
 * \subsection querydata_section Querydata control
 *
 * One may specify the querydata files to be used with the command
 * \code
 * querydata [filename1,filename2,...,filenameN]
 * \endcode
 * If the filenames are not absolute, and cannot be found
 * at the given places, the fmi.conf setting qdcontour::querydata_path
 * is used for searching for the file. As a special case, if the given
 * name is a directory, the newest querydata in that directory is used.
 * The time range one is able to contour is determined by the
 * common time span of the given queryfiles.
 *
 * Whenever a parameter is specified to be contoured, the order
 * of the queryfiles is the order in which the parameter is searched.
 *
 * Since one is only able to use one level when contouring,
 * one may choose it using the following command.
 * \code
 * querydatalevel [level]
 * \endcode
 * The default level is 1.
 *
 * \subsection filename_section Controlling generated image filenames
 *
 * As qdcontour goes through the available times in the specified
 * querydata, it will attempt to determine an unique filename
 * for each image. By default each filename is of the form
 * \code
 * [prefix][timestamp][origintimestamp][suffix].[format]
 * \endcode
 * The <em>format</em> is uniquely determined by using the
 * command
 * \code
 * format [format]
 * \endcode
 * where format is one of png, jpeg or gif.
 *
 * The prefix and suffix are by default null strings, but can
 * be modified with the commands
 * \code
 * prefix [prefix]
 * suffix [suffix]
 * \endcode
 * The <em>origintimestamp</em> is the time stamp string generated
 * from the origin time of the query data, and is intended for
 * distinguishing between various forecast times. Whether or not
 * the string is used can be modified with the command
 * \code
 * timestamp [0/1]
 * \endcode
 * Finally, the files must be stored in some directory, which
 * is controlled with
 * \code
 * savepath [path]
 * \endcode
 * The default value for <em>path</em> is ".", the current directory.
 *
 * For example, when contouring T2m forecasts one might use
 * \code
 * prefix ENN_
 * suffix _T2M
 * timestamp 1
 * savepath /foo/bar
 * \endcode
 *
 * \subsection contour_section Controlling the contours
 *
 * One is able to contour several parameters simultaneously.
 * The specifications for each individual parameter are started
 * by the command
 * \code
 * param [parametername]
 * \endcode
 * To draw contour lines on the parameter one can then repeatedly
 * use
 * \code
 * strokerule [blendrule]
 * contourline [value] [color]
 * \endcode
 * or define multiple lines simultaneously with
 * \code
 * contourlines [startvalue] [endvalue] [step] [startcolor] [endcolor]
 * \endcode
 * The colour for each individual line is interpolated linearly
 * between <em>startcolor</em> and <em>endcolor</em> in the HSV color
 * space, which is more likely suitable in this case than direct RGB
 * interpolation.
 *
 * One should remember, that the latest defined <em>strokerule</em>
 * is the one to be used for each <em>contourline</em>.
 *
 * Alternatively, one may specify some values intervals to be filled
 * with the desired colors by repeatedly applying the command
 * \code
 * fillrule [blendrule]
 * contourfill [startvalue] [endvalue] [color]
 * \endcode
 * As special cases, if <em>startvalue</em> is "-", it is interpreted
 * to mean minus infinity. Similarly <em>endvalue</em> would be interpreted
 * to be plus infinity. However, since the case
 * \code
 * contourfill - - [color]
 * \endcode
 * makes rarely sense, we define it instead to mean colouring all
 * missing values in the data. This is especially useful for data
 * which has limited range, such as radar data.
 *
 * Also, one may define multiple fills simultaneously with
 * \code
 * contourfills [startvalue] [endvalue] [step] [startcolor] [endcolor]
 * \endcode
 * which works similarly to the <em>contourlines</em> command documented
 * earlier.
 *
 * As with the case of <em>strokerule</em>, the latest defined
 * <em>blendrule</em> is the one to be used for each <em>contourfill</em>
 * command.
 *
 * Finally, one may use an image pattern instead of a fixed color.
 * This is accomplished using the command
 * \code
 * contourpattern [startvalue] [endvalue] [patternfile] [blendrule] [blendfactor]
 * \endcode
 * where <em>patternfile</em> is the path to the image file containing the
 * pattern to be used when filling. The filling is performed using
 * <em>blendrule</em> with the extra <em>blendfactor</em> alpha factor.
 *
 * There is no similar <em>patternfills</em> equivalent as before, as
 * interpolation between the start and end patterns would rarely make
 * sense.
 *
 * \subsection arrow_section Drawing arrows from querydata
 *
 * One may choose which parameters will be used as a direction - speed
 * pair when rendering arrows using the commands
 * \code
 * directionparam [parametername]
 * speedparam [parametername]
 * \endcode
 * The default values are <em>WindDirection</em> and <em>WindSpeedMS</em>
 * respectively.
 *
 * The arrow to be drawn at each location is defined with the
 * command
 * \code
 * arrowpath [filename]
 * \endcode
 * where <em>filename</em> contains an SVG-style (limited) path definition,
 * which will be rotated according to the direction parameter. The arrow
 * is rendered according to the rules specified by
 * \code
 * arrowfill [color] [blendrule]
 * arrowstroke [color] [blendrule]
 * \endcode
 * The size of the arrow is principally determined by
 * \code
 * arrowscale [scalefactor]
 * \endcode
 * whose default value is 1.0. The factor is used to scale the arrow
 * path definition uniformly. Additionally, one may also use the command
 * \code
 * windarrowscale [A] [B] [C]
 * \endcode
 * to scale the arrow nonlinearly and depending on the speed at the
 * location. The default values for a,b and c are 0,0 and 1 respectively,
 * and the formula applied to calculate an extra scaling factor for
 * the arrow is
 * \f[
 *   A \log (B S + 1) + C
 * \f]
 * where S is the speed value. Note that the value is always 1
 * for the default parameters, and no extra scaling thus occurs.
 * A is used to control linearly how fast the arrow grows, while
 * B is used to control it logarithmically. In general one should
 * try to find a suitable value for B first, to represent the speed
 * of increasing the size of the arrow, and then scale using
 * A to find a suitable final size.
 *
 * The arrows themselves are put on the image using the commands
 * \code
 * windarrow [longitude] [latitude]
 * windarrows [dx] [dy]
 * \endcode
 * The first form places the arrow at a specific location. Both the
 * direction and the speed will be interpolated, if necessary, for
 * the given coordinates.
 *
 * The second form places an arrow at each grid location, with the
 * given steps. Using <em>dx</em>=1 and <em>dy</em>=1 an arrow would
 * be placed at every grid point.
 *
 * \subsection label_section Placing text values in the images
 *
 * \subsection rendercontour_section Saving the results
 *
 * The contoured images can be saved using
 * \code
 * background [filename]
 * foreground [filename]
 * foregroundrule [blendingrule]
 * draw contours
 * clear contours
 * \endcode
 * The first command may be replaced with an <em>erase [color]</em> command,
 * provided a foreground is given. Alternatively the foreground may be
 * omitted, provided the background is given.
 *
 * The <em>clear contours</em> command is optional, and should only
 * be applied at the end of a file, or when the contour specifications
 * documented in the earlier sections really change.
 *
 * One may also modify each output image by overlaying some image on
 * top of them, for example a logo or a legend. This is accomplished
 * using
 * \code
 * combine [imagefilename] [x] [y] [blendingrule] [blendfactor]
 * \endcode
 * The extra image setting can be cleared using
 * \code
 * combine none
 * \endcode

 * \subsection color_section Color
 *
 * Internally the program represents colors using hexadecimal numbers
 * of form "AARRGGBB" where thr RGB components range from 00 to FF,
 * and the alpha component from 00 to 7F, 7F being transparent.
 * The highest bit is reserved for internal use to represent
 * the "none" color.
 *
 * The colors understood by the control file parser are
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dl>
 * <dt>none</dt>
 * <dd>This is a special color meaning no rendering is to be done.</dd>
 * <dt>transparent</dt>
 * <dd>This is equivalent to color #7f000000</dd>
 * <dt><em>colorname</em></dt>
 * <dd>The recognized names are listed in the table below</dd>
 * <dt><em>colorname</em>,<em>A</em></dt>
 * <dd>In addition to the color, one may specify alpha in the range 0-127.</dd>
 * <dt><em>R</em>,<em>G</em>,<em>B</em></dt>
 * <dd>The individual RGB components in the range 0-255.</dd>
 * <dt><em>R</em>,<em>G</em>,<em>B</em>,<em>A</em></dt>
 * <dd>The individual RGB components plus alpha in the range 0-127.</dd>
 * <dt>#AARRGGBB</dt>

 * \subsection blending_section Blending colors
 *
 * In general, one can define an arbitrary function Blend(color1,color2), which
 * given two colors would produce a result color. The qdcontour program understands
 * several such functions in common use in various graphical packages, and also
 * some in not so common use. Whenever rendering a color (source) on top of another
 * one (destination), qdcontour will store Blend(source,destination) as the new
 * destination color.
 *
 * First, below are the well known Porter-Duff rules:
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Clear</dt>
 * <dd>Both the color and the alpha of the destination color are cleared.
 *     The input colors are not used at all.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Copy</dt>
 * <dd>The source is copied to the destination. The destination is not used
 *     at all.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Keep</dt>
 * <dd>The destination is kept as is. This is a rather useless blending mode.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Over</dt>
 * <dd>The source color is composited over the destination using the
 *     linear alpha blending. This is the most common blending mode
 *     whenever alpha-channels are in use.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Under</dt>
 * <dd>This is similar to Over, but the roles of the colors are reversed
 *     in the formula. In effect, the destination is placed over the
 *     source.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>In</dt>
 * <dd>The part of the source lying inside the destination replaces
 *     the destination. Typically destination is some kind of a mask
 *     for picking a part out of the source.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>KeepIn</dt>
 * <dd>The part of the destination lying inside the source replaces
 *     the destination. This is similar to Keep, but with the mask
 *     role reversed.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Out</dt>
 * <dd>The part of the source lying outside of the destination
 *     replaces the destination.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>KeepOut</dt>
 * <dd>The part of the destination lying outside of the source
 *     replaces the destination.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Atop</dt>
 * <dd>The part of the source inside the destination replaces
 *     the part inside the destination.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>KeepAtop</dt>
 * <dd>The part of the destination inside the source replaces
 *     the part inside the source in the destination.
 * </dd>
 * <dt>Xor</dt>
 * <dd>Only non-overlapping areas of source and destination are kept.
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 * \endhtmlonly
 *
 * In addition, the following extra blending modes are defined:
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Plus</dt>
 * <dd>Add alpha-factored-RGBA values (Fs=1, Fd=1)</dd>
 * <dt>Minus</dt>
 * <dd>Substract alpha-factored RGBA values (Fs=1, Fd=-1)</dd>
 * <dt>Add</dt>
 * <dd>Add RGBA values</dd>
 * <dt>Substract</dt>

 * <dt>Multiply</dt>
